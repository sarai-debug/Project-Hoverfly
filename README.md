# Evolutionary rescue under temperature stress: the role of mutations improving life-history traits in hoverflies, a species with multiple life stages 

Theoretical Ecology Practical 2025

This project implements a stochastic population model to investigate evolutionary rescue in hoverflies exposed to temperature stress. The model simulates two life stages (eggs and adults) and two genotypes (wildtype and mutant), where mutations arise in eggs and affect fitness of life history traits. By running multi-generation simulations across a range of parameter values, the model evaluates how life-history traits and mutation rate influence the probability of population rescue versus extinction.
